# Gherkin test binaries

This directory contains cargo projects to build Gherkin test binaries.
These are used for acceptance tests (see Makefile in the repository root).

They are not part of the public API. You should not rely on them at all.
Command line flags can change anytime or the binaries can be removed altogether.
